I went to a local chiropractor's office and filled out their intake form for new patients. I put in my name, voice-over-IP (VoIP) burner phone number, an alias email and a P.O. Box for the address. I thought I had done everything right.

They then asked to see a photo ID and health insurance card for coverage. While I was talking, one of the ladies behind the counter took a quick photocopy of them. I told them I don't give you permission to take a hard copy of my driver's license. They said it's a HIPAA requirement and it's the law. That ticked me off a bit but I didn't let it show. I told them that I'm a security consultant and that I did HIPAA compliance audits (which is true) and I can assure you it is not the law and that I doubt you are storing the information in a HIPAA compliant manner. She refused to give it to me so I ignored it as I didn't want to create a scene as I'd be visiting that office frequently. I went to the chiropractor, whom I knew from before, told her about my disagreement with them storing an unredacted copy of my driver's license and she was very helpful. She assured me that they didn't store anything online and that she would go to the files and shred it herself to make me happy. I told her to hold on as the receptionist will get embarrased. I told her to get it later and to hand it to me on my next visit in a day or two and I will shred it myself. And that's exactly what happened. I was satisfied. I dodged that one!

A month later, I got mail from the chiropractors office at the address on my driver's license (not the address where I sleep, luckily) about some seasons greetings. On my next visit, I showed that to the receptionist and asked where she had gotten the address from? She said I gave it to them. I told her to check her files as I only provided a PO Box. She promptly said "I got it from your driver's license, I needed it for insurance purposes" (which was not true after I further confronted her). I told her that was sneaky, smiled and went our ways. But this incidence shows what they do, the moment they get your home address. They put it into their systems and send you marketing material. Most of them will share it with their "partners" and make money out of the sale.

So what is the solution? Show them a goverenment issued ID that does not have your home address on it.
There are a few options. I'll list my 3 best options below, from the most inconvenient to the most convenient.

## 1. Permanent Mailbox (PMB)

This is usually an mailbox that is not USPS (P.O. Box) and not a commercial mail arrier like USP or FedEx. It's usually a service provided for RV owners, or people who consider themselves a nomad, travel between different states and live out of their RV most of the times. They need a place to receive mail. You can have this kind of address on your driver's license (If your State allows. Talk to your DMV). But for most people, this is not a convenient option as you have to pay annually for a mailbox and take the time to fill out all the paperwork at PMB and your DMV. A lot of people cannot justify that change in their head. For them, there are 2 easier options.



## 2. Passport Card

This is a replacemnt for the passport book but can ONLY be used to travel to Canada, Mexico, Bermuda or The Cribbean. Another limitation is that you CANNOT use it to travel to those countries by air, ONLY land or sea. But if you apply for it and pay the $65 fee, you get a government issued photo ID with no address printed on it, valid for 10 years.

## 3. Global Entry Card

The easist and most beneficial of all the option is to apply for a **Global Entry Card**. This costs $100 for 5 years and provides you with the TSA Pre-check status on your boarding pass to walk-through the TSA checkpoints without being frisked (if you opt out of the full body scanner), without taking out your laptop, without taking off your belt and without walking in your socks collecting dirt from the floor. So this becomes very easy to justify. On top of that, you can get it for free if you use a certain American Express card (or others in the link below) that have the benefit of reimbursing the $100 for the Global Entry application. I've had it for 10 years now, applied for it twice and never paid anything for it because of the Amex offers.

*Note: Some of the credit cards will also pay for the $85 TSA PreCheck option. But if both are free, go for the higher value one.*

All credit cards with free TSA Pre: https://www.tsa.gov/precheck/credit-cards-offer
(Some will have the first year free, like Amex, and you can always cancel the credit card before the 12 months if you don't think you benefited enough from it and avoid their annual fees).

Now when I'm asked to provide photo ID anywhere (and most people will just ask for your Driver's License, when they actually mean any governemnt issued photo ID), I always hand them the Global Entry card as it does not have a home address written on it. I've never had anyone question it.
