## The Concern


You should avoid receiving ANY mail in you mailbox.

## Solution

This does not apply to Amazon deliveries or door-to-door delivereis by private mail darriers like UPS, DHL or FedEx. But sometimes they do leave main in your mailbox when they're in a rush or when it fits. You should also immediately get the mail inside if these carriers drop it off as Porch Pirates are also a real concern.
